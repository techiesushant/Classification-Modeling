# Business Objective:

- Telecom operator 'T' wants to reduce customer churn by predicting which customers are at high risk of churn within it's pool of prepaid services customers.
- Retaining high profitable customers will help in reducing significant revenue leakage.
- Type of churn to predict is 'Usage-based churn' i.e. Customers who have not done any usage, either incoming or outgoing - in terms of calls, internet etc. over a period of time.
- Churn prediction needs to be done using customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months June, July, August and September.
- Churn prediction to be done for the last month i.e. September.
- Focus will be on 'High Value Customers' i.e.the top 20% customers contributing around 80% of the revenue.
- Understand the customer behaviour during the good and action phase to predict churn in advance before customer enters churn phase.


#### The telecom operator wants to know:
- Whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
- Important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.


# Analytical Objective:
- Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).
- Build a classification model by employing a dimensionality reduction technique in order to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future.
- Build a classification model to determine significant variables that are strong predictor of customer churn.
